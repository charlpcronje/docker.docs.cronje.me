# Rust + Rocket Example

A more complex multi-stage build example that uses third-party Cargo crates (cargo-chef) to manage our dependencies.

## What's what

`Dockerfile` - contains instructions for how to build our Rust container

`src/Cargo.toml` - dependency and binary info for our app

`src/main.rs` - source code for a simple Hello World HTTP server
